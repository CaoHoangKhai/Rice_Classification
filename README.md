# Rice Classification on Rice Dataset

**Project Duration:** 19/09/2024 – 28/11/2024  
**Team Members:** 2

## 📖 Description
This project is a **machine learning application** designed to classify rice grains based on their physical characteristics. The system allows users to input specific measurements of each rice grain, including:

- **Perimeter**  
- **Major Axis Length**  
- **Minor Axis Length**  
- **Eccentricity**  
- **Convex Area**  
- **Extent**  

Based on these features, the system applies one of several machine learning algorithms chosen by the user to predict the **type or quality of the rice grain**. Supported algorithms include:

- Decision Tree  
- Logistic Regression  
- Bagging Classifier  
- Random Forest  
- Naive Bayes  

The application provides prediction results along with probability scores for each class. It is designed to save time and effort for rice inspection and classification and can be applied in production facilities, sorting centers, or quality control labs.
